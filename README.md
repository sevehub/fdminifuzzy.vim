# minifuzzy.vim :mag_right:
## A Cross-Platform Vim9 Fuzzy Finder

FdMinifuzzy is an oxidized fork of the original Minifuzzy, a Vim9Script fuzzy finder. FdMinifuzzy leverages the power of the *fd* command, written in Rust, to ensure seamless compatibility across various platforms.
FdMinifuzzy honors the rules specified in your projectâ€™s .gitignore file, ensuring that excluded files and directories are respected during fuzzy searches.

## :alembic: Usage
The following mappings can be used to fuzzy find:
